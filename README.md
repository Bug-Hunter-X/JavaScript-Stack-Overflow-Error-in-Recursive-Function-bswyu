This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a common error: a stack overflow caused by an improperly defined recursive function base case. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.  The issue arises from the recursive call `foo(a + 1, b)`; it fails to terminate when `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, leading to infinite recursion. The solution adds a check to handle this properly.
